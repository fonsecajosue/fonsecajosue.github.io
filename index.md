# Josue Fonseca's Portfolio

My major is Electrical Engineering and I plan to graduate in 2027. 

* Lab 1
  
This is simply my favorite lab, because it was the first time in which I felt like the lessons I was reading actually worked. I was processing everything the right way without having to go back to my notes as much. It gave me motivation to keep on reading the lessons and continue going to the lectures. 

* Lab 6
  
This is my second favorite lab because I was able to demonstrate how I can create loops and if statements. It allowed me to learn and adjust to the different problems I would encounter in the lab. I felt like this lab was challenging me so thatâ€™s why I really enjoyed it. 

* Lab 8
  
This is my third favorite lab, because I was working with numbers. This lab required us to use command-lines so that we have the ability to use the right number in the designated area. It was really fun!
